# 2048 with Classic Agents 

---

This project is a simple and brief realization of the **2048** game, with an additional implementation of classic agent training methods like **Minimax**.

The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. This version includes AI techniques to play the game automatically using some classic algorithms, accompanied with biref visualization of the 2048.
